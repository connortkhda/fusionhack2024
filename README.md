# fusionhack2024
Small solo project for the University of Southampton FusionHack Hackathon based around the theme of "Fusion": merging two things together, bonus points if they are seemingly unrelated.

For this project I have combined finance/stocks with astrology, and aptly named it "Astockagy".

The project is likely incompatible with Mac and Linux at this time and cannot be compiled to a jar.

Downlaod the project, navigate to /astockagy and run the command:
"mvn javafx:run -f "pom.xml""
